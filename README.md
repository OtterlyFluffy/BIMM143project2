# BIMM143project2

Hi! This is the first draft of Hillary's Project 2 for BIMM143.

Scientific Question: Are there structural/functional differences in the vaginolysin protein in Gardnerella strains ATCC14018 and ATCC14019 from women with symptomatic bacterial vaginosis (BV) and strain 409-05 from women with asymptomatic BV that impact the outcome of disease pathogenesis?  

Scientific Hypothesis: If the vaginolysin protein sequence between strains ATCC14018 and ATCC14019 in comparison to strain 409-05 shares less than a 80% sequence identity, then there are structural/functional differences in the vaginolysin protein in Gardnerella strains from women with symptomatic bacterial vaginosis and from women with asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis.
